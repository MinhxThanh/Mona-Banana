# Privacy Policy for Mona Banana Extension

**Last Updated:** 9/9/2025

Thank you for choosing Mona Banana! We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how we handle your data when you use our Chrome extension.

Our philosophy is simple: **Your data is yours. We do not collect it.**

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Mona Banana is designed to function without collecting any of your personal information. We do **not** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

*   **Your Images:** The photos you upload for the virtual try-on are processed directly in your browser and sent to the AI service you choose. They are never sent to or stored on our servers.
*   **Your API Key:** Your OpenRouter API key is stored exclusively on your local computer using Chrome's secure storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). It is only used to make direct calls from your browser to the OpenRouter API. We never have access to it.
*   **Browsing Activity:** We do not track which websites you visit or what products you view. The extension only activates on the specific shopping sites listed in its description to provide its core functionality.
*   **Personal Information:** We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect any personal identifiers like your name, email address, or location.

### 2. How Your Data is Used

All data processing happens locally on your computer or directly between your browser and the OpenRouter API.

*   **Local Storage:** Your API key and extension settings are stored locally on your machine. This is to ensure you don't have to re-enter your settings every time you use the extension.
*   **Image Processing:** When you generate a try-on, your photo and the clothing image are sent directly from your browser to the OpenRouter API for processing. The resulting image is then sent back to your browser. This entire process happens in real-time.

### 3. Third-Party Services: OpenRouter API

Mona Banana utilizes the **OpenRouter API** to perform the AI-powered image generation. When you use our extension, you are also subject to OpenRouter's policies. We are not responsible for their data handling practices.

We strongly encourage you to review their terms and privacy policy to understand how they handle the images and data you send them.
